# What does this program do?

This program matches a user to a randomly assigned country based on the user's chosen language fluency. The program also displays the calculated number of possible outcomes as well as the probability of matching (shown in the form of a fraction as well as a percentage) based on a chosen language and specialty. 

# How can I use this program?

Open the "CIS7 Team Unlucky Final Project.cpp" file in a C++ editor, assemble it, and run the program.

# How does this program work?

This is a program written in C++. 

In short, this program works by accepting inputs from the user after a series of prompts. The first two inputs are each validated by an if statement, followed by a switch statement to display a corresponding confirmation message based on the user's input. Srand is used to provide a truely random country picked from a multidimensional array, which was used to link together the languages and countries. A prompt is displayed telling the user the number of possible outcomes and match probability, followed by a prompt asking to loop. The program loops as long as the user inputs 'Y', and breaks if the user inputs anything else. The loop input is validated by an if-else statement at the end of the program. 

# Why is this program useful?

This program aims to be useful by providing a quick, user friendly way to match UCR medical center volunteers to a country based on a language that they are fluent in.
